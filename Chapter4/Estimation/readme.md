# Optimal Recovery in Estimation Theory

This folder contains numerical experiments on the application of Optimal recovery to estimation problems.

Case 1: Trivial approximation space V={0} and randomly generated error.

Case 2: Trivial approximation space V={0} and bounded error.

Case 3: Randomly generated approximation space V={0} and random error.

Case 4: Randomly generated approximation space V={0} and bounded error.
